# GitHub Workflow Guide for Claude Code

## Core Principles
- **NEVER work directly on main/master branch**
- **Always create feature branches for new work**
- **Test before committing**
- **Use Pull Requests for code review**
- **Make small, frequent commits with clear messages**

## Standard Workflow

### 1. Starting New Work
```bash
# Always start from main and create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/audio-improvements`
- `fix/transcription-timeout`
- `experiment/new-api-integration`
- `refactor/pipeline-cleanup`

### 2. Development Cycle
```bash
# Make changes, then:
git add [specific-files]          # Stage specific files
git commit -m "Clear description" # Descriptive commit message
git push origin [branch-name]     # Backup to GitHub regularly
```

### 3. Before Every Commit
- [ ] Run tests/pipeline to ensure code works
- [ ] Check `git status` and `git diff` to review changes
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data (API keys, passwords) in commit
- [ ] Ensure commit message describes the "why" not just "what"

### 4. Creating Pull Requests
```bash
# When feature is complete:
gh pr create --title "Clear title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Brief description of changes
- Why this change was needed

## Testing
- [ ] Pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Tested with sample data

## Notes
Any additional context or considerations

)"
```

### 5. Merging and Cleanup
```bash
# After PR is approved and merged:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/[branch-name]  # Delete local branch
```

## Claude Code Instructions

### When Recommending Commits:
**Instead of saying:** "Let's commit these changes"

**Say:** "I recommend creating a feature branch and committing these changes. Based on our GitHub workflow:
1. Should I create a feature branch for this work?
2. Have you tested the changes?
3. Shall I create a commit with these specific files?
4. Do you want a PR when this feature is complete?"

### Before Any Git Operations:
1. Check if we're on main branch â†’ suggest feature branch
2. Run tests if available
3. Review what files are being committed
4. Suggest appropriate commit message
5. Ask about PR creation when feature is done

### Commit Message Format:
```
Type: Brief description (50 chars max)

Longer explanation if needed:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Any important notes

Examples:
- "Fix: Handle API timeout errors in audio download"
- "Feature: Add retry logic for failed transcriptions"
- "Refactor: Simplify pipeline state management"
```

## File Management

### Always in .gitignore:
- `node_modules/`
- `.env` files
- Log files (`*.log`)
- Test data files
- Temporary files
- Build artifacts

### Commit Guidelines:
- **DO commit:** Source code, config files, documentation
- **DON'T commit:** Secrets, large files, generated files, test data

## Emergency Procedures

### Accidentally committed to main:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit, keep changes
git checkout -b feature/fix-commit
git commit -m "Move changes to feature branch"
```

### Need to undo changes:
```bash
git stash                # Temporarily save changes
git stash pop           # Restore changes
git checkout -- file   # Discard changes to specific file
```

### Fix last commit message:
```bash
git commit --amend -m "Better commit message"
```

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

Add this to your CLAUDE.md file:
```
## GitHub Workflow
Always follow the GitHub workflow guide in GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md:
- Create feature branches for all work
- Test before committing  
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create PRs for code review
- Ask user about workflow decisions
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Command | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Start new feature | `git checkout -b feature/name` | Always from main |
| Save work | `git add . && git commit -m "message"` | Test first |
| Backup | `git push origin branch-name` | Push regularly |
| Create PR | `gh pr create --title "title" --body "description"` | When feature done |
| Switch branches | `git checkout branch-name` | Check git status first |
| See changes | `git status && git diff` | Before committing |

**Remember:** This workflow prevents broken main branch, enables collaboration, and maintains project history. Always ask the user before making workflow decisions!
