[0:04] Speaker A: Hi, hi, Clara, it's Renzo to see you again, how are you? Sorry, I lost you.
[0:08] Speaker B: Yeah, I got disconnected, yeah.
[0:11] Speaker A: Sorry, you were saying that the real value of the home was about a million, right?
[0:14] Speaker B: It is, yeah. You know, it's the same floor, my condo is 1000 square feet. The one, what, 1500 square feet, was sold for 1 million and 400 something.
[0:32] Speaker A: Okay. Okay, I see. And you're living right now in Toronto currently?
[0:37] Speaker B: Yeah.
[0:39] Speaker A: Okay. Okay. And what's the value of your home? Sorry, what's the mortgage value currently? Is it 726?
[0:46] Speaker B: I had a four, $72,000 right now for the first mortgage, which is it's CIBC and I have a 253 with the second one. That one is a 12% interest. So it causes me. Yeah. And it causes me that I am keep falling behind of my payment. So it's really like, you know, impact my credit score. So because I can go with billionaire, but they told me, you need, this is advice. And that's how I know you because I went to home trust and equitable bank. And they said, they told me, they told me, if you work with the private vendor, like your company or other companies, and then, like, you know, between bad and worse, like, or whatever, like, what they said. And so if you can work with a company that they reduce your payments and then, and then. you work on your credit score for one year, two years, bring it all back, and then you come back and get your mortgage or the market will be better. At least you can sell the condo for a better price. Because right now with the amount of debt, everything, like, you know, I even can't get the money that I put, you know, and the people come and it's not a good market, like, actually. specific, but MojacanDo is different a little bit because we are not high-rise and it's a very good location. It's in Yangian, Yorke Mills. Usually it's so locally, like people downgrade who are living in a big house because it's a very nice building. It's just seven floors and it's very kind of, I can say high standard.
[2:45] Speaker A: And.
[2:48] Speaker B: So they usually don't go to Market that much. It's in 28 billion Carson, young and York minutes. So. And, you know, condos are not that much over there. So they are. They're hot in Market. But I, I want to try to keep it, you know, because if I lose it, I'm not. I won't be able to buy again.
[3:10] Speaker A: No, of course. I understand. Honestly, the market hasn't changed a lot since last year. You're right. the market, they kind of stayed the same. Yeah.
[3:17] Speaker B: But they, I talked to three, because as I said, I, I'm working in a bank. I work for a school share bank and I used to work in EQ bank. So this is, they told me, but next year it's going to be a next year and they're expecting especially in condo market is going to be really good.
[3:38] Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, usually the housing market lags the stock market by about 12 months. Right. And right now the stock market both in Canada and states is doing quite well actually. I don't know if you've heard but there, it's really really well. The housing market is a little bit slower, right, but it typically catches up, you know, six to 12 months after.
[3:54] Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. This is what exactly they told me. They told me if you can find a solution, I know my situation is not good, credit score is low. I'm like I'm struggling because of these high interest. and we had lots of issues. We had a loss in the family, like unexpected. I lost my sister. So I went through a lot. Like, I couldn't manage everything for six, seven months. So that's why it happened. Usually otherwise I was doing well. That's. But then that's why I need help. So I don't know what. I don't know what are the options sometimes. I'm not aware because they told me you have different options. It's not just second mortgage. It can be third mortgage. It can maybe we can put all mortgage for three, four years in one place. I don't know. Like that's why.
[4:49] Speaker A: Yeah. So just looking out the information you gave me, I want to just confirm a few things. You said your first mortgage, you said it's 473. Yeah. And that's with Scotiabank?
[5:00] Speaker B: CIBC.
[5:01] Speaker A: CIBC, sorry CIBC, you work at Scotiabank?
[5:04] Speaker B: Yeah.
[5:05] Speaker A: Okay, CIBC and your second mortgage is $253,000. Yeah. That's currently with a private lender. Yeah. When is the maturity for the private lender up? When is the renewal?
[5:15] Speaker B: In October, October 1st of October. That's why I have to... What's coming up? Yeah.
[5:21] Speaker A: October 1st, 2025. Okay, okay. And your CIBC, when did that mature?
[5:27] Speaker B: 2027.
[5:29] Speaker A: Okay, that's a little bit while away. Okay. Would you be by any chance open to breaking that CIBC maybe for just a year or what do you think?
[5:39] Speaker B: Just give me the options because I want to keep my house just you considering that I'm not having a good credit because if I had a good credit score I could have go to a creditable bank actually they would have refinanced and that is how they introduced you to me they said go find these places for one one year, two years, work with them closely and then, yeah.
[6:08] Speaker A: The reason why I'm saying is because you're right, you can get a third mortgage, that is a possibility. However, honestly, since you already have a large second mortgage of that amount, getting a third mortgage is going to be very expensive and it might not even be worth it honestly. The amount of fees the lender will take on, the interest rate is going to be astronomical, it's going to be much higher than your second.
