[00:00] Speaker A: Good afternoon, this is Jane from Capital Home Loans. I'm calling about your inquiry for a home purchase loan.
[00:08] Speaker B: Oh yes, hi Jane. Thanks for calling back. My wife and I are looking to buy our first home.
[00:15] Speaker A: Congratulations! That's exciting. What's your timeline for purchasing?
[00:20] Speaker B: We're hoping to close within the next 90 days if possible. We found a house we really like for $425,000.
[00:29] Speaker A: That's a great price point. Have you been pre-approved for financing yet?
[00:34] Speaker B: No, not yet. We wanted to shop around and find the best rates first.
[00:39] Speaker A: Smart approach. Based on that purchase price, you're likely looking at a loan amount around $380,000 with a 10% down payment.
[00:49] Speaker B: Actually, we can put down 20%. We've been saving for quite a while.
[00:54] Speaker A: Even better! That means no PMI and a loan amount of about $340,000. What's your household income?
[01:02] Speaker B: Combined, we make about $95,000 annually. Both of us have stable employment.
[01:09] Speaker A: Perfect. You should qualify easily. Our current rates for a 30-year fixed are around 6.25% for well-qualified borrowers.
[01:18] Speaker B: That sounds reasonable. What objections do people usually have to your loan products?
[01:24] Speaker A: Great question. Some clients worry about closing costs, but we often have programs that can help with those.
[01:32] Speaker B: Okay, I'd like to move forward with the application process.
[01:37] Speaker A: Wonderful! I'll get you started right away. This could be exactly what you need to get into your dream home.
