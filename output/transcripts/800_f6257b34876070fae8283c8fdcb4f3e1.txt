[0:06] Speaker A: Hello. Hey, Bridget, this is Gary from Blue Point Mortgage Group. How are you?
[0:11] Speaker B: I'm good. How are you?
[0:12] Speaker A: Good, good, good, Bridget. So I was just calling you. The reason was that you are seeking some funds for your retirement income, I guess.
[0:20] Speaker B: Actually, it's kind of like retirement, but it's kind of more like I'm just looking, you know, like, if you emergency funds, just like I was just wondering what we could get for a home.
[0:31] Speaker A: Equity Not a problem. And in the terms of funds, how much are you looking for? 50 to 75,000-ish? Yeah. Okay. And do you have a mortgage on your property at this current moment, Bridget?
[0:44] Speaker B: Yes, we do. It's with CBC Mortgage. Okay.
[0:49] Speaker A: CBC. And how much is it?
[0:52] Speaker B: 240, I think. I just renewed it, actually.
[0:55] Speaker A: Okay, $240,000.
[0:58] Speaker B: And we're roughly around that, maybe.
[1:00] Speaker A: Okay. and what's the rate of interest you're paying on that?
[1:03] Speaker B: I think it's like five. I got all the papers. I don't have them in front of me, but it's about five percent.
[1:09] Speaker A: Okay, not a problem, Bridget. So let me introduce you a little bit about myself. So my name is Gary. I'm a mortgage broker, and I'm registered with real estate board in Alberta, plus in British Columbia as well. Right. So when I say I'm a broker, so it means that I deal with 30 different lenders. So I can provide you with 30 different options in which I can guide you, in which way we can save you more. money and what kind of options will be suitable for you? Is it a line of credit, reverse mortgage or whatever option is more suitable for you for your requirement? Right.
[1:42] Speaker B: Okay. So the only thing. The only thing I don't want a second mortgage or anything like that.
[1:48] Speaker A: Okay. I don't want second mortgage. So not a problem. And do you know, like, how long is your term with the CBC?
[1:56] Speaker B: How long is.
[1:57] Speaker A: How long?
[1:58] Speaker B: How long?
[1:59] Speaker A: It's like two years, three years.
[2:01] Speaker B: Oh, I got, I think it's four.
[2:04] Speaker A: Mortgage, okay.
[2:06] Speaker B: Yeah.
[2:06] Speaker A: So based upon this, four years. Okay. So basically, I can see that what are the best possible options gonna be for you? Because I think if it's a four year term, the penalty is gonna be way too high, right? If you just upgrade it, like if you just renewed your term, right? So we have to see like what can we do. So for your scenario, I think it should be always a good idea to do a second line of credit as a second position, a line of credit from a private, which are basically a line of credit. Yes, rate of interest on that is somewhere between like 9 to 11%, but you only want to be paying the rate of interest on the funds when you're gonna use them, right? If you are not using the funds, they are just sitting there for your emergency purposes, so you don't need to worry about that kind of stuff. So something like that can be looked for you in order for you to make and save more money. But still we have to to see like is that the only viable option or is there anything else we can do for you as well, right? In the regards of saving you money, is there any other debts which you're looking to take care of?
[3:13] Speaker B: Not at the moment, no.
[3:15] Speaker A: Not at the moment, so that's good. And how many people are on the title?
[3:20] Speaker B: It's just me on the house.
[3:21] Speaker A: Okay, not a problem. So what we can do like yeah basically I like I have almost like two or three clients every month, right, just to get their line of credits. So what we can do, I can get some relevant information. I know you have a meeting somewhere around 11, so I can gather some relevant information to see like to which lenders I can present your scenario and to see like what will make more sense to you and what kind of a rate they will be able to offer it to you. And by like tomorrow morning or like tomorrow evening, I can send you a full proposal based upon it. Like this is how it's gonna be. And if you like the proposal, then we will set a game plan, then we will get some documents from you and we will set something in the place, okay?
[4:03] Speaker B: Okay.
[4:04] Speaker A: Sure, not a problem. So I'm just going to be asking you certain questions that will be like just me preparing your file. Okay, just give me one second and I am opening the application right down there. So what's your property value? Like you said between 300 to $600,000. Is that based upon like a city assessment?
[4:32] Speaker B: It's about, I would say it's an older house in an older area in Red Deer, which probably, I'm going to say about 350. We're just actually having a real estate broker come over to take a look at it this morning. That's coming at 11.
[4:47] Speaker A: Okay, you're trying to sell the property or how it is?
[4:51] Speaker B: We haven't quite decided yet.
[4:53] Speaker A: Because if that's the scenario, if you guys are looking to sell the property within a year or two, right, then I can definitely get you a open chip mortgage. That's a reverse mortgage. It doesn't have any payments on it. and for example, if I'll able to secure you somewhere around like $300,000 onto your mortgage, right? So that will take care of your initial mortgage plus extra $50,000 in your bank account. But we have to see that scenario as well, right? But the only way to get out from that is to selling your property. So if you don't want to go towards that side, then we can just look for the second line of credit, right?
[5:25] Speaker B: Okay. I will look for the last credit at this point, but let's see what you can do.
[5:30] Speaker A: Not a problem because I have to see the file, right? Like I have to present them. So the only hurdle which I think will be is going to be like a recently renewed $240,000. But let me work on it and I think I'll be able to get something around it.
[5:46] Speaker B: Okay.
[5:47] Speaker A: Okay. And you live in this property?
[5:49] Speaker B: Yes, we do.
[5:50] Speaker A: And what's the address of the property?
[5:52] Speaker B: It's 4508 56.

[5:57] Speaker B: 55-50.
[6:00] Speaker A: Okay. And what's the postal code you have?

[10:02] Speaker A: Welder. Okay. Beautiful. So you are hired by him or how it is.
[10:07] Speaker B: I do the books like I I own most of the company and then he owns five percent share. It's a corporation.

[10:20] Speaker B: Since 2004.
[10:23] Speaker A: Okay, that's fine. That's a long side on the company. Perfect. And this is good. And how about. how much you pay yourself?
[10:35] Speaker B: We do shares. So it's like our account looks after all that stuff, right?
[10:40] Speaker A: Okay. Is there any rough idea which you will be able to tell me?
[10:46] Speaker B: Yeah, I. I eventually, like, I'd have to talk to him. I think it's. I think last year I made 60 000 and my husband made 60 000.
[10:54] Speaker A: Okay. And did you go paid yourself as a dividends or. okay, so dividends, they are 60, 000 you made. And what's the name of your company?
[11:06] Speaker B: It's cjb. Welding limited.
[11:08] Speaker A: Cjb. Well, they limited. Yeah, that's perfect. And in the terms of assets, like, do you have any vehicle that are paid off or is there any other SPs under your name? No.
[11:26] Speaker B: Nothing right now.
[11:28] Speaker A: Or life insurance?
[11:30] Speaker B: We have life insurance, yes.
[11:31] Speaker A: Okay. And do you know how much is your policy?
[11:36] Speaker B: I think my husband's is 150 and mine is 100, I think roughly around there.
[11:41] Speaker A: 100,000. Okay. And does it include everything like a critical illness or if something happens with the mortgage or nothing?
[11:48] Speaker B: No.
[11:49] Speaker A: Not a problem. So just to let you guys know that basically at the Blue Pearl we don't only deal with mortgages, we also build a profile, like a business profile for the clients. so that for it is basically for you guys like who are self-employed and have like a corporations, right? So that you guys can build yourself a policy which you can get paid more, spend less and you will be able to get like saving more taxes in the future. I'll guide you that way as well once we're able to get this thing done too. Yeah. Okay. So in the terms of property, Bridget, this is the only property you own?
[12:23] Speaker B: Yes.
[12:24] Speaker A: Okay. And this is good. And how long your company is from 2000 and which year you told me?
[12:32] Speaker B: Four.
[12:33] Speaker A: 2004. Company is. Company is 2004. Okay, that's good. And in your any close relatives in your family is associated in politics, domestic or international? no. No. So what's gonna happen, Bridget? You're just gonna receive the email right now from a velocity. That's basically a CRM system, which me and my lenders use. Right. So you don't need to worry about it. It's just a basic email. So what happens? Like, I'm a licensed broker, so I will get access to your file, and on my behalf, I will be able to submit your file to, like, different lenders. Right. So when I say submitting it to different lenders, so you don't need to worry about that, it's gonna bang your credit every single time I submit it. No. It's only going to be one single inquiry from Blue Pearl Mortgage Group. And then because we are licensed brokers, so we will be able to set your file to the other places without getting it inquired again and again. It's not like my car or a credit card.
[13:35] Speaker B: Okay. If I get a credit like a home actually done on the house, that doesn't affect my credit rating, right?
[13:42] Speaker A: Owning a line of credit doesn't because it's basically same thing like owning a credit card, right? If you are making the payments on time and if you have like funds in your account and your credit utilization is onto a good side of a thing, right? So then you don't need to worry about nothing. It is just kind of like a credit card, but you are getting like a high amount, so you are getting it against your house, right? So this is how it is.
[14:04] Speaker B: Okay, all right.
[14:05] Speaker A: Not a problem. So do you have a, do I have your consent to go ahead and look at your bureau?
[14:10] Speaker B: Yes, you do. Sure.
[14:12] Speaker A: Just give me one second and I will open that for you. Do you know like how much is your score sitting at right now?
[14:20] Speaker B: My score was actually quite good, but it's dropped. We've been kind of struggling like we're in the oil field. So up and down with work and stuff. So I think it dropped down to 698 or something.
[14:36] Speaker A: No worries. Let me check that for you and let me tell you what are impacting our score, right? Just give me one second on to this thing. Where did you check your score? Like is it on Equifax or TransUnion?
[14:50] Speaker B: I just checked through my personal bank.
[14:54] Speaker A: I think you're maybe a little bit wrong on that. It's sitting on good standing on my side. Your credit score is around 742. So you are on the good side and nothing is impacting you. So currently you have a mortgage balance of 205,000. $11,000.
[15:14] Speaker B: Okay.
[15:15] Speaker A: And you're paying like 1277 every month? Yeah. Okay. And this 80B financial, is that auto loan or what it is like a $35,000?
[15:26] Speaker B: It's a holiday trailer.
[15:29] Speaker A: Holiday trailer. Okay. And it is just under your name or it's under your right? Yes. okay and finance it Canada. It's again a six thousand dollars. Is it your credit card?
[15:48] Speaker B: It's Home Depot. It was a equity. Look, I, we built, did a bunch of Renovations last summer.
[15:55] Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Okay. So the thing which is, to be honest, impacting your credit at this particular moment will be one of this credit card because 7500 is the limit and you use like almost around like 5,400. So this is the one which is a main culprit down there and another one which I see is a main culprit is the BMO credit card which you have right for 5,046 is used. So whenever we are going exceeding like a 30% of the total debt that will impact our credit. So this Royal Bank Visa, is it a line of credit you have or for 14,000?
[16:30] Speaker B: It's a Visa.
[16:32] Speaker A: It's a Visa card. Okay. this is good. And from your Finance. And there is another ATB, right? Loan for you for 17 000.
[16:46] Speaker B: It's a hot.
[16:47] Speaker A: Okay. Okay, that's good. And PMO, this one is doing good. So looking at your credit over here, Bridget, I feel like it's better if we able to. Find an option related to like a full mortgage blanket, right? Because what happened, your debt ratios are high, right? And try to get you like consolidate as much as that we can into one, right? And try to get you some extra funds on that so that you have availability of your credit cards as well, your line of credit as well, and the other options too. Okay.
[17:24] Speaker B: So not a second mortgage. I don't want a second mortgage.
[17:28] Speaker A: No, sir, not second mortgage. That's what I am saying. So I wanted you to do one thing for me if you can, like whenever you have time, can can you call CBC mortgage and just without even saying anything, just can you ask them, like, if you close your mortgage, right?
[17:44] Speaker B: Yeah.
[17:45] Speaker A: Like in the next month or so, how much is they gonna charge you the penalty? So, for example, if the penalties are only around like four to five thousand dollars budget, right? But it end up saving you almost like thousands of years per year on your interest rate. But then based upon your credit, if.
[18:01] Speaker B: You'Re gonna amalgamate all my, my debt into the mortgage. My mortgage is going to go up and I don't want that.
[18:07] Speaker A: You don't want that. Okay, so not a problem. So let's do this way then. Just take it with the line of credit onto the second side and let me see, like, what are the best option available in the market for you? Is there any other challenges, Bridget, which I will be missing at this moment? Like, is there anything you want to tell you or anything to CRA? Property taxes are all. up to date?
[18:29] Speaker B: Everything's up to date, yes.
[18:31] Speaker A: Okay, beautiful. So what's gonna happen, Bridget? I will run this file to my lenders and I'm gonna take one or two opinions from a different lenders and see like whichever is able to get us a good value of the thing and by tomorrow morning or evening I will get back to you, we'll give you a rough idea and let you know like what we are dealing with, okay?
[18:49] Speaker B: Okay, that sounds really good, thank you.
[18:52] Speaker A: Not a problem, Bridget, have a great day ahead, we'll see you tomorrow, sorry. Bye.
