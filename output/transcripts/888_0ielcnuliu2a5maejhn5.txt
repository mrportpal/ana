[0:08] Speaker A: Hello. Hi. Hi.
[0:12] Speaker B: I was looking for Jeffrey Stokes wife.
[0:15] Speaker C: Yes.
[0:16] Speaker A: Hi.
[0:16] Speaker B: I was talking regarding his. Regarding a mortgage, and I believe you had some questions for me.
[0:24] Speaker C: Yes. I did ask. some questions.
[0:32] Speaker D: Did you already talk to him this morning?
[0:34] Speaker B: No, not yet.
[0:35] Speaker E: Did you want me to call him first?
[0:38] Speaker C: No, we can't still talk.
[0:41] Speaker D: Okay, he was saying.
[0:46] Speaker A: That.
[0:48] Speaker C: There was a second company that.
[0:53] Speaker A: Has.
[0:56] Speaker C: Like an investment something but I didn't really understand it.
[1:02] Speaker E: Okay, so it's not a second company.
[1:04] Speaker B: It'S the same company. What it's what we were saying is.
[1:08] Speaker E: Instead of Jeffrey here putting 100 whatever.
[1:12] Speaker B: Money he has for the credit sorry not for the credit for the apartment.
[1:19] Speaker E: Right, and getting in like a 5%.
[1:21] Speaker B: Interest rate, will put his money into an investment that gives you a 10% return, right, and that way all the money that he makes from the investment will be used to pay for the mortgage payment. The mortgage payment is going to be around like 2 grand or sorry not like 13, 14 hundred dollars and that's how much he's going to make off the investment so he doesn't have to really use his money, his money still.
[1:43] Speaker E: Like will be 100-140,000 you'll have but.
[1:46] Speaker B: You'Ll also have the apartment and the mortgage. We're just using the investment funds in order to pay for the mortgage.
[1:55] Speaker D: Okay, so and the apartment price I.
[2:01] Speaker C: Think is about 250 something.
[2:05] Speaker F: Yeah.
[2:07] Speaker C: So are you going to pay that's.
[2:10] Speaker E: Yeah, so we'll give you a mortgage.
[2:12] Speaker B: For the 250,000 and then well the money that he has 100 and something we'll put into an investment and then.
[2:20] Speaker E: The investment returns will essentially pay for.
[2:23] Speaker B: The mortgage so we'll get him a mortgage against his current property Right, and then from that property we'll give him the 250 and from there he'll be able to essentially pay for the new mortgage as well.
[2:40] Speaker D: So like you mean his house, like.
[2:44] Speaker C: The place we live now, the mortgage.
[2:47] Speaker B: Would be put on that property, yeah.
[2:50] Speaker D: On that property, yeah.
[2:53] Speaker C: So can't the mortgage be put on this house he's buying?
[2:57] Speaker B: The apartment?
[2:59] Speaker C: Yes.
[3:01] Speaker B: Yeah, we can look into that. He might need to put a little bit down payment then, then we can go the investment route. then we have to go the traditional route like where he just gets a regular mortgage, right? At his age 69 is gonna be a little bit tough. Are you gonna be on title, do you know?
[3:18] Speaker C: You said?
[3:19] Speaker E: Are you gonna be on title?
[3:21] Speaker B: Is your name gonna be on the house?
[3:24] Speaker C: The new one?
[3:25] Speaker F: Yeah.
[3:27] Speaker D: I'm sure he's gonna do everything himself.
[3:30] Speaker C: Or maybe he's gonna include me, it all depends.
[3:34] Speaker B: Okay.
[3:35] Speaker E: Yeah, that's. I mean, if you're on it, because.
[3:38] Speaker B: You'Re working currently, so we can use you as a stable income for him. I don't think he's working currently, right?
[3:44] Speaker D: I'm not working also.
[3:46] Speaker C: I'm still schooling.
[3:48] Speaker B: Are you sure in school? Okay.
[3:50] Speaker D: Yes.
[3:52] Speaker B: Do you get.
[3:53] Speaker E: Do you make any sort of money?
[3:58] Speaker C: I think it's a government that. gives them money for going to school, right?
[4:08] Speaker A: Yeah.
[4:08] Speaker B: So they'll probably give you kids benefits as well.
[4:12] Speaker C: The child benefit, they gave us to be able to receive it was July 3rd. That was, I think, this weekend.
[4:22] Speaker F: Yeah.
[4:22] Speaker D: But I have to get a hold of them. I still don't know when they'll start the payment. because I haven't received the email yet.
[4:31] Speaker B: So, okay.
[4:32] Speaker D: It means it is two. Two choices.
[4:35] Speaker F: Yeah.
[4:35] Speaker G: Yeah.
[4:37] Speaker C: If he invests in your company, you put a lien on his house.
[4:44] Speaker G: Yeah.
[4:44] Speaker B: And it's not a lien. We just. It's.
[4:48] Speaker A: There's.
[4:49] Speaker B: For the investment, there's no lien required. It's only if we put a mortgage on his house.
[4:54] Speaker D: Or you put some mortgage on this house.
[4:57] Speaker B: So we would give them, we would take the 100-140,000 invest it at a higher interest return of 10%, give them a mortgage for about 5%, 5.5%, right? And then the remaining 4.5, which is profit, can be used towards his mortgage payments because the investment is only 100-150,000.
[5:14] Speaker E: Whereas the mortgage is about 250,000, right? So, the difference in the price makes.
[5:21] Speaker B: Up with the return on the investment. So you're making 10% on your money.
[5:24] Speaker E: But your mortgage payments are about five.
[5:26] Speaker B: And a half percent. So you can use it like that. That's what my game plan was.
[5:32] Speaker D: With my understanding, it means the profit.
[5:36] Speaker C: That he's going to make with the.
[5:40] Speaker D: Investment he's going to make.
[5:42] Speaker B: Yeah, he's going to make.
[5:44] Speaker C: He's going to need to pay.
[5:46] Speaker B: Off the mortgage.
[5:47] Speaker E: Yeah, but he doesn't have to worry about it.
[5:50] Speaker D: So you will pay off the house.
[5:53] Speaker C: So let's say.
[5:56] Speaker D: The mortgage that you.
[5:58] Speaker C: Give him, how many years are you going to give him?
[6:01] Speaker B: It depends. He can choose, but like generally they always go for the longest term so that it's the lower payments, right? So we can go like a 30-year term, 25-year term. 35.
[6:16] Speaker C: That's too much.
[6:17] Speaker E: If it's less, if you want a.
[6:19] Speaker B: 15, the payments are going to be very expensive. Like 15 year term for a $250,000 mortgage. It's going to be like $2,000 a month.
[6:41] Speaker C: Yeah 2000 a month but if it's.
[6:44] Speaker B: For 15. that's for 15.
[6:48] Speaker C: That'S for.
[6:49] Speaker B: How much 250 000.
[6:53] Speaker D: No no so.
[6:54] Speaker C: What what I mean is if he puts his 140 down yeah then his.
[7:03] Speaker B: Mortgage is only gonna be like In.
[7:05] Speaker D: Terms of mortgage, it would be a.
[7:07] Speaker C: Total of $110,000 mortgage. That's what I'm trying to understand.
[7:11] Speaker B: So that's a traditional mortgage. We can do that too. Traditional mortgage, 15 months would be like $1,000 a month, 900 bucks a month.
[7:20] Speaker E: All right, that's then he doesn't do.
[7:23] Speaker B: The investment, then that's just a regular mortgage that he's going to get on the new apartment. He puts $100,000, $140,000 down, whatever. I would say only put $100,000 down.
[7:31] Speaker E: That we have $40,000 for payments.
[7:33] Speaker B: So we have $150,000 mortgage and that's going to be around $1,200 a month. At least you still have the $40,000 that you can use for payments though, right?
[7:43] Speaker E: Because neither of you guys are working right now currently.
[7:48] Speaker B: You want some, you don't want to put all your savings into the mortgage. That way when the payments come and you need some help with the payments, there's going to be no money left over, right? So what you want to look into is keeping some money into the savings like $40,000. Put a hundred thousand into the mortgage and then we give you a mortgage for about 150 and from there you can use that to make the payments for 15 months. It's gonna be 1182 but if we do 20 20 years, it's gonna be a thousand dollars 985.
[8:20] Speaker E: Right, so if that's the route you.
[8:21] Speaker B: Want to go into I can I can discuss that with Jeffrey as well.
[8:24] Speaker E: That just give them a traditional mortgage.
[8:29] Speaker D: And then now one, will you still.
[8:31] Speaker C: Put a mortgage on his current house?
[8:34] Speaker E: No, no, that would. That would be through the.
[8:36] Speaker B: That would be through the new place than the apartment.
[8:40] Speaker D: Okay, so looking at the two options.
[8:43] Speaker C: You being in the field, which one do you think is the best? Because I don't know much about businesses. I'm new to it.
[8:54] Speaker E: Okay, but if you guys aren't working, how are you guys gonna make the.
[8:58] Speaker B: Payments of a thousand dollars a month?
[9:00] Speaker G: Right?
[9:01] Speaker B: That's my question. And neither you or Jeffrey's working, and it's just 140 000 you have saved up. How are you guys gonna.
[9:08] Speaker E: How are you guys gonna manage to.
[9:10] Speaker B: Pay the mortgage after your forty thousand dollar runs out?
[9:13] Speaker C: Like when. When do you plan on starting? He's renting. He has a tenant renting him two bedroom.
[9:19] Speaker E: Okay, so he makes a little bit rent money.
[9:22] Speaker C: Yes. He makes like 900 or something. Right?
[9:28] Speaker A: Yeah.
[9:29] Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
[9:31] Speaker G: Yeah.
[9:31] Speaker B: I mean, then we can look into a month.
[9:33] Speaker D: Thousand dollars a month. He can't pay.
[9:37] Speaker B: He can pay a thousand.
[9:38] Speaker F: Yeah.
[9:39] Speaker A: Yeah.
[9:40] Speaker D: Because we are doing that. The other type of mortgage.
[9:45] Speaker B: The traditional mortgage, right?
[9:47] Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
[9:48] Speaker B: So, yeah, there's a two options.
[9:50] Speaker E: Investment.
[9:51] Speaker B: Investment. He can do that, too. Put 100, 140, 000, make about 10, 000, 12, 000 a year and use that to pay off the mortgage.
[10:00] Speaker G: Right.
[10:00] Speaker B: But then it's gonna be a longer term, right? 25 years. It's all about timing for him because he's a little bit older, too. I believe, Jeffrey, he's about 69 years old.
[10:08] Speaker C: Yes.
[10:09] Speaker A: Yeah.
[10:09] Speaker E: So it's like how gonna be harder.
[10:11] Speaker B: For him to get approved for that long of a term to what's gonna be shorter, like 15 years or 20 years or something like that.
[10:17] Speaker D: And then if it has to run.
[10:20] Speaker C: Then I will have to be on it so that I can pay because.
[10:24] Speaker D: I'll be done with school soon and.
[10:26] Speaker C: Then I'll get a job.
[10:28] Speaker A: Okay.
[10:29] Speaker B: When are you going to be done with school?
[10:33] Speaker E: When are you going to be done with school?
[10:36] Speaker B: Like when are you going to start working?
[10:39] Speaker D: They said I have my practicum in January or something.
[10:42] Speaker C: So I think I'll be done by January. Yeah.
[10:45] Speaker B: Okay, you're trying to be a nurse?
[10:48] Speaker D: No, I'm trying to be an addictions worker.
[10:51] Speaker C: Mental health.
[10:52] Speaker B: Nice. That's good.
[10:54] Speaker C: Yes. That's the program I'm doing.
[10:59] Speaker E: Okay.
[11:05] Speaker G: Yeah.
[11:05] Speaker B: So those are two options. It's either he invests, gets 10 return and use the investment money to pay off the mortgage.
[11:11] Speaker E: That way he can save up whatever.
[11:13] Speaker B: The rent money he makes and plus the thing.
[11:15] Speaker E: Or he can put $100,000 down, have.
[11:19] Speaker B: $150,000 mortgage for like 15-20 years and just pay that out of pocket, right?
[11:25] Speaker E: But that's up to you guys.
[11:27] Speaker B: If you guys are willing to pay $1,000 a month, sure, we can look into getting you guys approved here. Now, of course, with his age and everything and income sharing is a little different. He's just getting rent and pension only, right? we have to see what lenders are going to work with that. And plus says, like, you guys are a little bit more rural, right?
[11:44] Speaker F: What?
[11:44] Speaker B: What city were you guys looking? The apartment in? It's in Kamloops, right?
[11:50] Speaker G: Yeah.
[11:53] Speaker B: 1760. He said he gave me an address yesterday.
[12:05] Speaker E: He'S looking at 1760 Bruner.
[12:15] Speaker B: Let me see his property. 9789 Meadow Road, right? Darfield. yeah, his value.
[12:32] Speaker E: His value is about 790 000. So, yeah, getting a mortgage on either.
[12:36] Speaker B: Or would not be a problem, right?
[12:39] Speaker C: Yeah, but he doesn't have a title on the house.
[12:43] Speaker A: What? How?
[12:44] Speaker E: Who's the house under?
[12:48] Speaker C: Like, he bought it with cash.
[12:50] Speaker D: Do you get my point?
[12:51] Speaker B: Oh, okay.
[12:54] Speaker G: So.
[12:54] Speaker B: Yeah, I know. That's why he's still waiting for inspections and stuff to complete, right?
[12:59] Speaker D: You said?
[13:00] Speaker E: Yeah, he said he's waiting for the.
[13:01] Speaker B: Inspections to get completed.
[13:04] Speaker G: Yeah.
[13:04] Speaker C: So with that, can you still loan him money?
[13:09] Speaker E: Probably not on that property, to be honest.
[13:12] Speaker B: Not until he has title and not until he has inspections completed.
[13:17] Speaker E: We would need a title and all.
[13:19] Speaker B: That to be done.
[13:21] Speaker E: But that being said, we can just.
[13:22] Speaker B: Get you traditional lending, then, to be honest, I don't think the investment thing is going to work out, we should probably just look into getting him a.
[13:30] Speaker E: Regular, just a regular mortgage up.
[13:35] Speaker C: Even with the investment one, you still need a title.
[13:40] Speaker E: No, investment you don't really need a title. You can always invest his money. It's for them more, if we were.
[13:47] Speaker B: Going to get a mortgage against that property, so yeah, we would, because then.
[13:51] Speaker E: It'S going to be hard for hard.
[13:54] Speaker B: For us to get a mortgage on that in order to pay for the apartment, right?
[13:58] Speaker E: If there's no title and it hasn't passed inspections or anything, we're gonna want.
[14:03] Speaker B: To, because the plan was to invest that money and get the 10% and then instead of doing a traditional mortgage, we get him another different mortgage from through this property.
[14:16] Speaker E: And then, but this property won't have, this property doesn't have a title or.
[14:22] Speaker B: Anything, so it's not a.
[14:24] Speaker D: So even the first, the first option.
[14:26] Speaker C: Like the investment one, is not going to work.
[14:29] Speaker E: Yeah, the first ones probably won't work. I'll have to look into it a.
[14:32] Speaker B: Little bit more, but I think the traditional one might just work where you guys put a hundred thousand dollars down and you guys get a mortgage.
[14:42] Speaker A: A.
[14:42] Speaker B: Mortgage for your, your, this, the camel's property, camel's apartment. Okay, so I don't think we should do the investment option. We should just look into getting a traditional mortgage.
[14:58] Speaker D: That's because he doesn't have a title on his house.
[15:01] Speaker E: That's because he doesn't have a title on house, yeah.
[15:05] Speaker D: So even the investments will not work because he doesn't have a title.
[15:11] Speaker B: So if he wants to do just the investment, it will work. But if he wants to do the investment and get a mortgage, then it won't work.
[15:18] Speaker C: Oh, okay.
[15:20] Speaker A: Yeah.
[15:20] Speaker B: So he can do just the investment. Sure. We can get good money.
[15:24] Speaker E: But if you guys are planning on.
[15:26] Speaker B: Using the hundred thousand, hundred forty thousand for.
[15:29] Speaker E: For the apartment, then maybe not the investment.
[15:32] Speaker B: Because then we would look into getting lending against. Landing against his.
[15:38] Speaker G: Yeah.
[15:39] Speaker B: 9789 metal. Metal Road house. I'll have to look into it. I'll see if there's another way around it, but.
[15:46] Speaker E: We can't get lending on that house.
[15:47] Speaker B: If there's no title and he just bought a cash and what not, no sales history, right? So we'll have to look into that. But I think honestly just a traditional mortgage would be better.
[16:00] Speaker C: Looking at his income, his pension, do you think he qualifies for about $100,000 or $150,000?
[16:08] Speaker B: Yeah, we can get him $150,000. That's no problem.
[16:12] Speaker E: We have a lot of different lenders.
[16:13] Speaker B: We work with 40 different lenders.
[16:16] Speaker G: Right?
[16:16] Speaker B: So we work with the big banks and the alternative lenders and private lenders.
[16:21] Speaker E: Some of them require less documents and less income and whatnot. So we can definitely get them approved.
[16:27] Speaker B: That's no problem. It's just where we get them approved and what interest rate we get them approved with.
[16:31] Speaker A: Right?
[16:33] Speaker C: And then is the interest rate, like usually how much is the interest rate going to be?
[16:40] Speaker E: It's gonna be in like the, for.
[16:42] Speaker B: Him since it's gonna be a little bit different. I don't know.
[16:46] Speaker E: We have to see once we got.
[16:49] Speaker B: More documents and stuff for income, but probably in like the four to six percent in that range, maybe a little bit higher depending if we have to go private, right? If we have to go private, then it's gonna be like probably six to seven percent.
[17:03] Speaker E: But that's the problem for you guys.
[17:05] Speaker B: That's the only people that are gonna give you an approval. Cuz the big banks they're not gonna touch your file for $150,000 mortgage especially if Jeffrey's age is at 6970 Right, so they're not gonna it's gonna be hard for him to get approved through a traditional mortgage But we can't do.
[17:26] Speaker D: That way looking at things like this.
[17:28] Speaker C: Assuming we have this kind of money and I wait how much money am I supposed to be able to make.
[17:35] Speaker E: How much money do you need to make in order to afford the place?
[17:39] Speaker C: To be able to afford, yes, a mortgage and put that money has down.
[17:44] Speaker D: With the child benefits.
[17:46] Speaker E: Okay, give me one sec.
[17:50] Speaker B: I have to check here. Okay, give me one second.
[18:47] Speaker E: We get you approved for like, if.
[18:49] Speaker B: You have like 30-40k income.
[18:53] Speaker C: Oh, so that's for 35k for a year.
[18:59] Speaker B: Yeah, for a year.
[19:03] Speaker E: It's like minimum wage almost because 150.
[19:05] Speaker B: 000 mortgage isn't that much.
[19:09] Speaker E: Can you say yeah, 150 000 mortgage.
[19:12] Speaker B: Is actually pretty low. We can like, you don't need to show that much income.
[19:15] Speaker E: 30 to 40 000 would be good.
[19:17] Speaker D: 30 to 40,000 so assuming okay if.
[19:21] Speaker C: You make your 2,000 times 2,4 okay so even if you make 2,000 a month you can't qualify for 150,000 that's.
[19:31] Speaker E: 2,000 a month or 2,000 bi-weekly oh.
[19:36] Speaker B: You mean week no so 30,000 $24,000.
[19:41] Speaker E: If you're making 2,000 a month that's 24,000 a year Then yeah, you can.
[19:46] Speaker B: Still probably get approved as well.
[19:49] Speaker C: You said 30,000, right?
[19:52] Speaker B: 30,000, yeah.
[19:54] Speaker C: For a year, right? If I can get 30,000 a year.
[19:57] Speaker D: I can be approved for 150,000.
[20:02] Speaker A: Yeah.
[20:03] Speaker D: For how many years?
[20:05] Speaker B: That's, I did 30 years for now.
[20:08] Speaker E: But if you want to do 15, Maybe 20. 20?
[20:14] Speaker A: Yeah.
[20:23] Speaker E: 20 years, you would also need around...
[20:35] Speaker B: 30,000 is more than enough.
[20:36] Speaker E: Especially if you guys don't have any other debts.
[20:39] Speaker D: No, we don't have any debt.
[20:41] Speaker E: Yeah, so that's fine. 30,000 is more than enough for the.
[20:45] Speaker B: Approval for 150,000 with $100,000 down payment.
[20:49] Speaker E: You guys are good with 30-30k combined household income.
[20:56] Speaker D: So assuming maybe the top benefit is.
[20:59] Speaker C: Like a thousand and they say monthly I make a thousand. so that's like 2, 000. So.
[21:06] Speaker F: Yeah.
[21:07] Speaker E: So you make a thousand a month per kid?
[21:11] Speaker C: I think it's going to be more than that because I think so. My children and my husband is also not working, so.
[21:18] Speaker F: Yeah.
[21:19] Speaker E: So you're making about 2, 000 a month. Plus your husband makes rental money and.
[21:23] Speaker B: He has a CPP and pension, right?
[21:26] Speaker A: Yes.
[21:29] Speaker B: Yeah, but if you're not going to be on title, I don't know if we can use your income.
[21:37] Speaker C: If I am going to stand because he's not working, right? So if we are going to join our income together, I'm still going to be on the title.
[21:47] Speaker B: Okay.
[21:48] Speaker A: Yeah.
[21:48] Speaker B: So if you join your income together.
[21:50] Speaker D: Yes, if we are using the children's.
[21:52] Speaker C: Benefits, assuming we get approved, like soon. And then Jeff adds his pension.
[22:02] Speaker A: Yeah.
[22:02] Speaker D: I will have to be on title.
[22:05] Speaker B: Okay.
[22:05] Speaker A: Yeah.
[22:05] Speaker C: Because the child benefit comes to the women.
[22:09] Speaker A: -Huh.
[22:11] Speaker C: And then assuming I. I get a job.
[22:15] Speaker F: Yeah.
[22:16] Speaker A: And.
[22:17] Speaker C: And we are doing it. I'll still be on title.
[22:20] Speaker G: Yeah.
[22:20] Speaker D: He doesn't have a problem.
[22:22] Speaker E: If he doesn't have a problem, that's fine.
[22:24] Speaker B: We can just add you one title. Then you have a combined household income of so much more.
[22:27] Speaker E: We'll get you approved through a good.
[22:29] Speaker B: Interest rate, like four and a half, five and a half percent interest rate.
[22:33] Speaker D: Okay, that's going to be for how many years?
[22:36] Speaker B: It's your choice. I can put in the request for 15, 20, 25. As long as you have 30, 40k to show.
[22:45] Speaker C: It's not going to be on the private.
[22:47] Speaker B: Yeah, we can probably get you approved with the big banks.
[22:49] Speaker E: It depends though because okay, some of.
[22:51] Speaker B: Them have like a little bit more stricter rules and stuff so it depends what big banks we submit them with.
[22:57] Speaker E: I mean, I know Jeffrey has a.
[22:59] Speaker B: Really good credit score.
[23:00] Speaker C: I'm out of the event.
[23:02] Speaker D: Yeah, he doesn't like oh, he doesn't.
[23:04] Speaker B: Like no, I know so it's too. Yeah, that's fine if your credit score is good as well. We probably get you in but even.
[23:10] Speaker E: If the a lenders won't approve your.
[23:13] Speaker B: File, we have B lenders that will approve your file. So so that's okay.
[23:16] Speaker E: And then there's a separate group that's private.
[23:19] Speaker B: So B has really good interest rates like A lenders do.
[23:23] Speaker D: Oh, B, okay.
[23:25] Speaker E: Yeah, so there's A, which are the.
[23:27] Speaker B: Big banks, and then B, which are like different lenders, alternative lenders.
[23:31] Speaker C: Oh, okay. Okay. And, all right. So let's say.
[23:40] Speaker D: Okay, for now, that's.
[23:41] Speaker C: What we can afford. We can't afford anything more than.
[23:47] Speaker G: That.
[23:48] Speaker A: Yeah.
[23:48] Speaker B: What do you think the max payments a month is? $1,000 a month?
[23:52] Speaker C: You said?
[23:53] Speaker B: You what do you think the max.
[23:55] Speaker E: Payment should be around $1,000 a month?
[23:57] Speaker D: Yes, $1,000 a month.
[23:59] Speaker B: Okay.
[24:02] Speaker D: And then if we say we want.
[24:07] Speaker C: Something bigger, we need to earn more than that, right?
[24:11] Speaker G: 200.
[24:15] Speaker B: If you do longer term, if you do 25 years, and if you're on title, then how old are you, sorry?
[24:20] Speaker D: I'm 45.
[24:21] Speaker E: Yeah, so if you're on title, yeah.
[24:23] Speaker B: We can probably do longer term, which is 25 years, which is, then you're looking at.
[24:40] Speaker E: You knew like 180,000 extra plus your 100,000 down, that's like 280,000. It's about 1,077 a month.
[24:50] Speaker C: 1,077 a month.
[24:54] Speaker D: So we can get 180,000 loan.
[24:58] Speaker E: You can, do you want 180?
[25:02] Speaker D: You know he's still looking, right?
[25:04] Speaker B: So I was just looking in case.
[25:06] Speaker C: We find something that is more expensive than that.
[25:09] Speaker A: Yeah.
[25:10] Speaker C: Let's see if he finds something that is about. But 300 000, he's going to say he would rather buy a house.
[25:18] Speaker B: Okay.
[25:18] Speaker G: Yeah.
[25:19] Speaker B: With 300, you're better off just buying.
[25:21] Speaker E: A house and having a rental unit in it. That way the rental can just pay for the mortgage.
[25:25] Speaker D: But I don't think 300 000 can.
[25:28] Speaker C: Buy a house now.
[25:30] Speaker B: And cam loops.
[25:31] Speaker C: Do you think?
[25:32] Speaker A: Yeah.

[27:47] Speaker C: See if we can go have a look at it.
[27:49] Speaker A: Yeah.
[27:50] Speaker D: For now, since we know we can.
[27:52] Speaker C: Qualify for.
[27:56] Speaker D: A mod gate.
[28:02] Speaker C: I just wanted explanations on what we were doing. Yeah, yeah, yes.
[28:08] Speaker B: Because I think the best.
[28:12] Speaker C: Too far from town for me and the kids.
[28:13] Speaker B: Yeah.
[28:14] Speaker C: And I'm going to wake the kids up to go to school. So he still wants to keep the house. He doesn't want to sell it.
[28:19] Speaker A: Uh huh.
[28:20] Speaker D: So that's why we want to buy another house.
[28:22] Speaker B: Oh, okay.
[28:23] Speaker A: Yeah.
[28:24] Speaker B: I mean, just put a hundred thousand dollars down, save forty thousand dollars for the. For the mortgage payments. You'll be good for 40 months, which is basically three years, three and something years. You won't have to worry about a payment. after 40, 000.
[28:38] Speaker C: So for now, even if I'm not working, can Jeff income get a mortgage?
[28:44] Speaker A: Yeah.
[28:45] Speaker B: With just.
[28:45] Speaker E: With just a CCB income. Your current income, you get the child benefits, right?
[28:52] Speaker D: Yes, but I haven't received it yet.
[28:55] Speaker B: Okay.
[28:57] Speaker A: Yeah.
[28:57] Speaker B: So when you start receiving it, we can use that and we can use his income and you guys can get.
[29:02] Speaker C: Can we just use. only the child benefits with gifts and pension?
[29:10] Speaker E: I'd have to see what lenders would.
[29:12] Speaker B: It wouldn't be with the big banks, it'd be with the B lender.
[29:15] Speaker E: But yeah, we would need to show.
[29:17] Speaker B: Some sort of income to prove that you are actually getting money or like bank statements or something to prove income rate because we can't just give you a mortgage and you're not working, right?
[29:29] Speaker E: Because then how are you going to make the payments?
[29:30] Speaker B: You're going to default on your mortgage.
[29:32] Speaker A: Yeah. All right.
[29:33] Speaker B: So we need to make sure that.
[29:35] Speaker C: You'Re gonna, you're gonna put it on him because he's receiving expansion.
[29:39] Speaker F: Yeah.
[29:39] Speaker C: Child benefits. And then we joined the two together.
[29:42] Speaker B: Yeah, we can do that.
[29:46] Speaker D: Just the child benefits with his pension.
[29:49] Speaker B: Yes, that's no problem.
[29:51] Speaker E: Because that combines like three, four thousand.
[29:53] Speaker B: Dollars a month, right?
[29:54] Speaker C: That's how much?
[29:56] Speaker B: Combined with his pension and your, the CCB you're gonna get for both your kids.
[30:00] Speaker E: It's gonna be, it's gonna be around.
[30:03] Speaker B: Three, four thousand a month that you guys are making.
[30:08] Speaker D: Okay, so let's make that because I.
[30:10] Speaker C: Don'T know how much I'm gonna receive for the 12 months. So let's make that one like maybe 1200?
[30:15] Speaker E: For both of them combined?
[30:17] Speaker D: For the kids, yeah, because I don't.
[30:18] Speaker C: Know how much I'll receive.
[30:20] Speaker E: Okay, so 1200 plus his pension, which.
[30:22] Speaker C: Is about, oh, maybe just a thousand. I know it is gonna be more if it is small.
[30:27] Speaker D: Then yeah, yeah so a thousand is.
[30:30] Speaker C: Pension with his rent yeah so let's say thousand plus let's say let's say his pension is a thousand his rent so let's say maybe he makes like 2005 a month -huh with a child benefit like 2005 a month okay.
[30:54] Speaker A: That.
[30:54] Speaker B: Should be more than enough.
[31:01] Speaker C: All right, so that's gonna be like 30,000 the year. So with 30,000 you think he can borrow about 150?
[31:13] Speaker B: Yeah, he borrowed 150 to 170 in that range.
[31:17] Speaker C: Oh, okay. Right.
[31:20] Speaker A: Okay.
[31:21] Speaker C: Okay.
[31:22] Speaker B: So, yeah, so look around for some properties around. Yeah, I'll give them a call in a little bit. I just have another call.
[31:28] Speaker C: Now we have somebody to help us.
[31:30] Speaker F: Yeah.
[31:31] Speaker D: Then we will keep looking.
[31:33] Speaker A: Okay.
[31:33] Speaker C: We can't get 200.
[31:36] Speaker B: 200? No, it might be a little bit hard.
[31:39] Speaker C: That means we will have to top up on our deposit.
[31:42] Speaker F: Yeah.
[31:43] Speaker C: Okay.
[31:44] Speaker B: If you get 200, we're gonna have to show more income.
[31:47] Speaker A: Yeah.

[31:49] Speaker C: Thank you for your explanation and time. You should talk to Jeff. Let him know you spoke to me.
[31:55] Speaker G: Yeah.
[31:55] Speaker C: And then I explained that I haven't received the child benefit yet, but I might. Maybe we put it at a minimum rate.
[32:04] Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
[32:05] Speaker D: 1000 and then extension with his rent. So let's say 2005 a month for all of us.
[32:13] Speaker A: Okay.
